    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>Howl's Moving Castle</em> is one of Hayao Miyazaki's many exquisitely animated (and profoundly confusing) expressions of destiny, growth, and love.  An even more ubiquitous theme in his films, however, is food.</p>

        <p>Few can so magically inspire hunger as the sizzling breakfast served up courtesy of Calcifer's demonic flames - can some at-home know-how help us bring the magic into our own kitchens?</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large piece of pork belly (about 3 lbs), skin removed</li>
            <li>4 1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>6 packed Tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup distilled water</li>
            <li>1 tsp pink curing salt (Prague Powder #1)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup distilled water</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp applewood </li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cherrywood </li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>Sliced bread</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut pork belly to size so it will fit in a Ziploc bag to marinate. Make sure skin has been removed from pork belly</li>
            <li>Mix kosher salt, coarsely ground black pepper, brown sugar, distilled water, and curing salt in bowl until combined</li>
            <li>Put pork belly into Ziploc bag and add curing solution. Squeeze as much air out of the bag as possible before sealing. Place bag in high-walled container (e.g. a casserole dish) to prevent cross-contamination. Refrigerate for 3-5 days, flipping once per day</li>
            <li>Add 2 Tbsp applewood and 2 Tbsp cherrywood to bottom of stovetop smoker. Top with drip plate, followed by roasting rack. Place pork belly on top of roasting rack. Cover entire stovetop smoker with aluminum foil</li>
            <li>Add stovetop smoker to burner over medium heat. Insert temperature probe into pork belly to monitor internal temperature. After smoking for 30-45 minutes, move entire pan to oven</li>
            <li>Finish pork belly in 225°F oven for another hour, or until it reaches 150°F internally. Place meat in Ziploc bag and chill for about 4 hours</li>
            <li>When completely chilled, remove bacon from bag and slice strips to desired thickness</li>
            <li>Fry strips of bacon in cast iron skillet over medium-low heat</li>
            <li>Once fat has rendered out, add 4 cracked eggs to pan. Cook until the eggs have good crust. If whites need to cook more, kill heat to pan and cover with lid to steam tops of egg whites</li>
            <li>Serve eggs and bacon with sliced bread, cheese, and a good sprinkle of salt and pepper. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
