    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>Spirited Away</em> features a girl named Chihiro, who must work in a spa for magical spirits. She must find her enchanted parents, who have been transformed into pigs by the spa's proprietor and may soon be served for dinner to the guests! When Chihiro despairs of freeing herself and her parents, her friend Haku gives her a Japanese rice ball (“onigiri”). As she eats, Chihiro renews her resolve to defeat the sorceress. </p>

        <p>This onigiri recipe differs slightly from the one in the film. The simple rice, light salmon, and salty roasted nori combine to make the perfect snack. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 minisheets of roasted seaweed ("nori")</li>
            <li>3/4 cup shredded cooked salmon</li>
            <li>1 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
            <li>6 cups cooked sticky rice</li>
            <li>triangle-shaped cookie cutter</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice nori sheets in half lengthwise. Mix mayonnaise into salmon until well-coated. Set salmon mix and nori aside</li>
            <li>Cool or reheat rice until slightly warm.</li>
            <li>Place cookie cutter on flat surface. Lay 8″x 8″ sheet of plastic wrap over cookie cutter. Push down so inside of cookie cutter is completely lined with plastic wrap</li>
            <li>Scoop rice into bottom of cutter and press flat</li>
            <li>Place salmon filling into middle of the rice, spreading slightly, so there will be salmon in each bite of rice when finished</li>
            <li>Scoop more rice atop salmon and flatten out as before</li>
            <li>Wrap plastic tightly over exposed surface of onigiri. Pop onigiri out of cookie cutter. Firmly wrap loose ends around exterior of onigiri. Set aside</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining rice and salmon until out of ingredients</li>
            <li>Let set for 5-10 minutes. If planning to consume later, microwave inside plastic wrap for no more than 20-25 seconds</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, remove plastic wrap and press nori strip around the bottom of onigiri</li>
        </ol>
